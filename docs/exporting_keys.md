Exporting Keys
---

In the auth_credentials.py file in code folder, you can
see all the keys which are required by the bot to function.
They are configured to accept values from the environment.

***Firstly for Github:***

Create your own sample organization. Add a sample team to it.
Use [this](https://developer.github.com/v3/teams/#list-teams) to get
the team ID.

***For LUIS API:***

Sign up for a free account [http://luis.ai/](http://luis.ai/).
Create a new app and train it (read more on how to do that
[here](nlp_explainations.md)). Then publish it and get
the path uid(a - separated unique id) and subscription key.

***For Slack:***

We are working on event mocking. But you can still test out
the API functions. First join the sample workspace
[here](https://join.slack.com/t/sysbotsample/shared_invite/enQtNDAzMTU2MTkwNTYyLTIwYzQ2ZTk0YzQ4MzM1MGRjMjI0ZjkxOTdlYjRlNTg5OTU4ZDM5YzFmMWYxNjAwYzg2OWY1MzA1Y2FiOGQxZjI)
This workspace has been set to mock the main Systers workspace.
All the project channels have been created with same name as that
on Systers.

To generate the tokens for the sample workspace,
simply activate the virtual environment and then type:

```
sudo bash ./generate_tokens.sh
```
It will generate the bot and legacy tokens. Export these into the environment as well.
